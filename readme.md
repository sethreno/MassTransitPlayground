Mass Transit Singe Active Consumer / Routing Demo
===============

The demo includes two console apps:

Consumer
--------
Includes configuration to create the queues and exchanges as well as a consumer
that will log all the messags it recieves.

Running the app with the following parameters:

    dotnet run --clientCodes "aag,aark,ametro"

Will create an exchange named "message" that routes messages to client specific
queues based on the ClientCode property of the message. Because the queues have
the Single Active Consumer flag on a single consumer for each queue will be
chosen as "active" and will recieve all messages. This will likely be the first
consumer to start up.

```mermaid

    message-->aag-message;
    message-->aark-message;
    message-->ametro-message;

    aag-message-->consumer-a;
    aark-message-->consumer-a;
    ametro-message-->consumer-a;

    aag-message-.-consumer-b;
    aark-message-.-consumer-b;
    ametro-message-.-consumer-b;

    aag-message-.-consumer-c;
    aark-message-.-consumer-c;
    ametro-message-.-consumer-c;
```

The messages will not be load balanced, but will switch over to one of the
backups if Consumer A goes offline.

```mermaid

    message-->aag-message;
    message-->aark-message;
    message-->ametro-message;

    aag-message-->consumer-b;
    aark-message-->consumer-b;
    ametro-message-->consumer-c;
```


You can run multiple instances of the consumer app to see how the "Singe Active
Consumer" SAC setting works. There are also additional command line options that
may help with learning. Here's another example that shows all the options:

    dotnet run `
      --clientCodes "aag,aark" `
      --delayInSeconds 3 `
      --prefetchCount 16 `
      --concurrentMessageLimit 10


Producer
--------
Includes configuration to send messages to the "message" exchange using
ClientCode as a routing key. It doesn't know there are separate queues for each
client.

It can be run with the following command:

    dotnet run --clientCodes "aag,aark,ametro" --publishPerSecond 1
